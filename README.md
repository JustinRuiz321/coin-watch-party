## Project Links
Deployed site on Heroku:
Github Repo:

## Project Objective
We wanted to create a user friendly experience where crypto first-timers can learn and observe the growth of cryptocurrencies.

## User Story
AS someone with no knowledge of cryptocurrency, I WANT to subscribe to a page that can teach me about it, SO THAT I can be more informed and potentially become involved in purchasing. I WANT its current value, its peak value, and a link to view its history.

## Technologies
bcrypt, express.js, npm, sequelize, express-handlebars, heroku, bootstrap, node.js, express-session, dotenv.

## Installation
Cloning the repo directly off of Github.

## Usage
You may run this app with the deployed Heroku link or by cloning the repo and running it through your own local host.

## License
No license currently

## Reference
The course material helped greatly in completing this assignment.

## Challenges
We initally planned on making an application where you can select which cryptocurrency you'd like to watch and have it saved onto your profile with the option to buy or sell, however due to time constraints we were unsuccessfully able to accomplish that.

## Tests
npm test
